Breaking the accessibility barriers for blind children

Hundreds of electronic games for children are existing nowadays and almost all require that users have good eyesight. But blind children are still children! They have right to happiness and to a quality life. Also, they seek for acceptance of their individuality and recognition of their increased needs for accessibility and autonomy.

LEAP is a version of the legacy Tic-Tac-Toe game, especially modified for visually impared people. It can be played with the solely use of audio. Note that the usage of headphones is mandatory. It is a [We are all citizens](http://www.weareallcitizens.gr/index_en.html) project, funded by [EEA grants](http://eeagrants.org) and [Bodossaki Foundation](http://www.bodossaki.gr/en/home).
