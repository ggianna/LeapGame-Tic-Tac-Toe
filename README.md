Breaking the accessibility barriers for blind children

Hundreds of electronic games for children are existing nowadays and almost all require that users have good eyesight. But blind children are still children! They have right to happiness and to a quality life. Also, they seek for acceptance of their individuality and recognition of their increased needs for accessibility and autonomy.

LEAP is a [We are all citizens](http://www.weareallcitizens.gr/index_en.html) project, funded by [EEA grants](http://eeagrants.org) and [Bodossaki Foundation](http://www.bodossaki.gr/en/home).
